# AirQ
- AirQ is a python script that serves the purpose of comprehensive air quality monitoring and prediction. Its goals encompass data preprocessing for missing value handling and feature engineering, visualizing air quality parameters and trends, conducting time series analysis with seasonal decomposition and SARIMA modeling, and assessing AQI levels among different cities using ANOVA tests.
- The provided Python script is part of a comprehensive air quality monitoring and prediction project. It begins by loading air quality data from a CSV file, performing data preprocessing to impute missing values and engineer new features. The script offers various data visualization tools for analyzing air quality parameters, trends, and AQI values in specific cities. It also utilizes seasonal decomposition and SARIMA modeling for time series analysis, forecasting AQI levels, and calculating performance metrics. Additionally, the code conducts ANOVA tests to compare AQI levels across different cities. In summary, this script combines data analysis, time series modeling, and statistical testing to provide valuable insights into air quality variations and trends among different urban areas.
